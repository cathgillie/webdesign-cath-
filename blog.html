            <h4> Red Scale: A fun little film project I was apart of in early 2021. </h4>
            <p> One thing that is important to me is being grounded and align with myself, this is something that
                is
                easily overlooked when life gets busy. To keep the feeling of being grounded I dedicate time to the
                things that I love, this includes; spending time with my loved ones, making sure my space is clean
                and tidy, going to the beach, putting my records on and of course, using my film camera. So I joined
                a film club in Geelong and its been great!!
            </p>
            <p>
                The process of film club is that each month you receive a theme to follow, take your time to capture
                images within said theme and meet up to show your results. At the end of each meeting you receive a
                new theme and go again. One theme I loved in particular is red scale.
            </p>
            <p>
                Red scale is the process of purchasing a brand new roll of film and cutting off the beginning of the
                roll that is curved so that the roll is completely straight. You then find an empty canister of
                film, and tape together the straight end of the film from the new canister to the little bit of film
                left in the empty canister. From there you push both canisters together so no light will expose the
                film, and wind the film from the new canister into the old one. Once the roll of film is completely
                wound in you cut in-between each canister to seperate - but be careful not to cut any sprockets
                because the film wont be able to be processed. Lastly you take the beginning of the film you cut off
                previously and use that as a guide to cut a curve at the new start of the roll.
            </p>
            <p> A roll of film is layered with different colours, starting from yellow to blues to magentas. When
                winding the roll backwards it changes the order of the colour, therefore when the light hits the
                film when a photo is taken, it hits the red colours first creating a red scale image.I had so much
                fun capturing my images as I had no idea how they were going to turn out, my inspiration ranged from
                an art gallery, the beach and the streets of Lorne. I love photogrpahy, and this keeps the fun in
                things.

                    <h4> Body Empowerment. </h4>
                    <p>
                        MY FIRST PROPER PHOTOSHOOT! This was a super special moment for me as this project was was
                        super special to me, and I couldn’t of asked for a better shoot experience to kick start me
                        off.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Body is a project that is all about educating, empowering and supporting individuals who
                        struggle with body and mental health related issues due to the poor standards social media
                        as put forward. The aims this project is to create PDFs for educators to download and add
                        into their curriculum as the education system leaves out so many important learning
                        experiences. The photoshoot was incredibly wholesome and such an amazing learning experience
                        for, it really clarified just how much I love photography and the atmosphere of shoot days.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The photos captured and edited will further be used for instagram content and for the
                        website once it goes live! Body and mental health related issues are something that I have
                        also struggled with for a large part of my life, so being able to be a part of this was
                        incredibly uplifting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I went through and edited what I belived to be the most promising photos (which I also
                        loved!)

                                    <h4> The Veda Varcoe Special. </h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Veda Varcoe; an intelligent, wholesome ray of sunshine! I met Veda nearly
                                        two years ago as a mutual friend had invited us both to attend in gig in St
                                        Kilda, Melbourne, and I have not looked back. Veda is not only now one of my
                                        very dear friends, she is also beautiful musician and I had the privilege of
                                        taking some film photos for her first Headlining gig.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        An intimate Affair was Veda’s first headlining show located at the Hue & Cry
                                        art gallery in Geelong CBD. Living up to its name the gig as super intimate
                                        with only a small gathering of close fiends and family, the space was quite
                                        small with a floor covered in rugs and pillows and lamps to keep things
                                        moody.An incredible space created by an incredible girl. As the night
                                        started and began to progress people started finding their way around the
                                        gallery and chat (following covid safe measures of course) using disposable
                                        cameras as requested I started to capture the movement of people, trying to
                                        overthink about being weird and creepy.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The starting act was an artist named Indigo Blue, a mesmerising performance
                                        with a voice that calmed the crowd. Performing all her own acoustic music
                                        Indigo Blue showed her talent in songwriting along with a confident stage
                                        presence and cheeky smile, leaving the crowd wanting more. Next was the
                                        beautiful Veda, playing her aqua electric guitar with a matching amp she
                                        wooed the crowd. Playing all original songs - new and old - she sang so
                                        softly and warm you could feel the energy swift in the crowd as they all
                                        relaxed and embarked in such a special human do what she does best.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        As the night progressed I walked around taking photos and capturing special
                                        moments of the night. Being a disposable, I couldn’t adjust the settings to
                                        create a clear image but they still turned out well.
                                    </p>
