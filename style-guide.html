  Red Scale Images: 
         
  This is a fun little film project I was apart of early 2021. </p>
<p>
  It's the process of purcasing a brand new roll of film and cut off the beginning of the roll that is curverd so that the roll is completely straight. 
  You then find an empty canester of film, and tape together your new straight end of film from the new canaster to the litle bit of film left in the empty canaster.
  From there you push both canasters together so no light will expose the film, and wind the film from the new canaster into the old one.
  Once the roll of film is completely wound in you cut inbetween each canaster to seperate - but be careful not to cut any sprockets because the film wont be able to be processed. 
  Lastly you take the begining of the film you cut off previously and use that as a guide to cut a curve from where you cut to separate the canasters. 
</p>
           
<p> 
  A roll of film is layered with different colours, starting from yellow to blues to magentas. When winding the roll backwards it changes the order of the colour, therefore when the 
  light hits the film when a photo is taken, it hits the red colours first creating a red scale image.
